# openapi-types

This repository contains TypeScript type definitions for multiple versions of the OpenAPI specification. Each version is organized in its own subdirectory and published as a separate npm package (e.g., [`openapi-types-v3.1.0`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openapi-types-v3.1.0)).

## Purpose

-   **Centralized Source:** Hosts type definitions for all supported OpenAPI spec versions.
-   **Versioned Distribution:** Each version is published individually to npm for easy integration.
-   **Type Safety:** Use these types to ensure your code adheres to the relevant OpenAPI spec version.

## Structure

-   `3.1.0/` — Type definitions and documentation for OpenAPI 3.1.0
-   _(future)_ `3.0.3/`, `3.0.2/`, etc. — Additional versions as needed
